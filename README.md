Bash helpers for hosting sites.

## Getting started

### Debian 9

To get going quickly there are install scripts to load a VPS with a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache2, MariaDB, PHP).

```bash
sudo bin/install-debian-lamp
```

## Adding a virtual host 

To add a new virtual host use the setup script to begin a new host/vanity host layout.

```sh
sudo bin/setup 
```
